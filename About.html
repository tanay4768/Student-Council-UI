        is an administrative organization of students in different educational institutes ranging from
        elementary schools to universities and research organizations around the world. 
        These councils exist in most public and private K-12 school systems in different countries. Many universities, both private and public, have a student council as an apex body of all their students' organisations.
        Student councils often serve to engage students in learning about democracy and leadership, as originally espoused by John Dewey in Democracy and Education (1917).</p></div>
